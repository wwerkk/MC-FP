# Music Computing Final Project
Implementing language modelling for concatenative audio synthesis.

## Real-time
For real-time generation and synthesis with any of the included models:
1. run ``python generate.py -p /Users/You/MC-FP/models/modelname``
2. open ``resynthesis.maxpat``
3. pick the correct model using the drop down menu in top left corner
4. turn on audio and press space to start predictions and playback
5. twiddle with some parameters
